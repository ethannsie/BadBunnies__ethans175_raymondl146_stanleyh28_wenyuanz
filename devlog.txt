* MASTER UPDATE:
* demoPivot contains code that allows user to take 60 pictures as fast as the computer is able to given the camera connected to the computer
* This was combined with OBS Virtual Camera and Droidcam, but is being pivoted toward a dart/flutter dynamic website/app for phone/computer usage

* Pivoting to font/word transcription instead of video
* Easier to accomplish with an AI model and uploaded images

* Added Design Doc

DESIGN REVISIONS THUS FAR:
------------------------------------
* Added specific analytics
* Specified amount of data needed by user; system notification

* here's the game plan AFTER MUCH DELIBERATION AND TESTING
* Handwritten Text to Digital Text will be processed as follows
  * Train our model based on word identification
  * This bounds both words and individual letters
  * Our model can then give a more or less close transcription of an image
  * THEN, we can send this into an LLM to get a much closer meaning of the initial users writing
  * DICLAIMER: not 100% accuracy but hopefully 100% will not be gibberish
* Digital Text to Emojis
  * SIDE: Using some vectors, tokenization, semantic meanings, we are converting words to emojis!
  * This uses some AI similarity for KNN and transformers for semantic meanings
  * Cool tangential but related transcription tool
