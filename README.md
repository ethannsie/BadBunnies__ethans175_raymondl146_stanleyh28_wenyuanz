## Site Description:

This project is focused on handwriting recognition using machine learning. We aim to convert handwritten documents into digital text by processing user-uploaded images or PDFs. While we start by cleaning and analyzing the images, our main goal is to train a model to recognize handwriting accurately. Since handwriting varies greatly between users, we hope to improve the model over time with user corrections. To make the project more interactive, users will be able to manage their own handwriting samples, view the transcribed text, and optionally contribute to improving the modelâ€™s accuracy. If possible, we will also work on a feature that will allow users to create their own font based on their handwriting.
